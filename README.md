## Hello 🫡

I'm Toby, a self-taught programmer and computer science student from germany.

So far, I have the most experience in Java and Kotlin, but I like experimenting with many different tech stacks, depending on what suits my projects the best.

Apart from programming, I love working out and watching formula 1.

My biggest project yet is my own training app for both Android and IOS.
